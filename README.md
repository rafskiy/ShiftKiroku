# ShiftKiroku 🕒

ShiftKiroku is a simple and free work-hour tracking web app designed for APU students (and beyond!) to easily log and manage their work hours, view analytics, and simplify timesheet management.

## 🌟 Features

✅ Create and edit your own job types — fully user-based jobs, not hard-coded.  
✅ Add **break criteria** (e.g., add a break after a certain number of hours).  
✅ Set **weekend bonuses** easily per job.  
✅ Edit or delete jobs anytime.  
✅ Dashboard with:
  - Filter by job type
  - Monthly and yearly charts
✅ Submission details viewer with improved “View Detail” page.
✅ Modern, responsive UI with mobile support.
✅ Toggle **dark mode** (your choice is remembered across sessions).
✅ Secure authentication (email/password).
✅ Privacy first: all your data is tied to your own account.
✅ Fully localized and translation-ready (multi-language support coming soon).

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

Password and privacy are **highly valued**. All data is stored securely on Google Firebase, and as the sole developer, your information is kept strictly private. No third parties or ads.
